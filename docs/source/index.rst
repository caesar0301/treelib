`Tree data structure
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28data_structure%29>`_ is an
important data structure in computer programming languages. It has
wide applications with hierarchical data connections say file systems
and some algorithms in Machine Learning. `treelib
<https://github.com/caesar0301/pyTree>`_ is created to provide an
efficient implementation of tree data structure in Python.

The main features of `treelib` includes:

	* Simple to use in both python 2 and 3.
	* Efficient operation of node indexing with the benefit of dictionary type.
	* Support common tree operations like **traversing**, **insertion**, **deletion**, **node moving**, **shallow/deep copying**, **subtree cutting** etc.
	* Support user-defined data payload to accelerate your model construction.
	* Has pretty tree showing and text/json dump for pretty show and offline analysis.
